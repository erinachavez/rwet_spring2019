### Assignment 6: Garbled

*April 16th, 2019*

---
With this assignment, I was free to either use word vectors or the CMU pronouncing dictionary to create a new poetic form. Thus after some experimenting, I decided to use the CMU pronouncing dictionary to create a program that could read in a text input, and create garbled sentences that *sound* similar to the original text.

**Sample Output**

```
