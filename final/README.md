### Final: The London Underground

*May 7th, 2019*

**Sample Output**

```
In London, the few clouds are healing
I jumped down the carpet store and push into North Wembley
Acidly, I climbed onto the Bakerloo Line
My weariness uplifitingly trembley

I transferred at Edgeware Road
A travel agent with a slow eyebrow
I discover an exit astride the Hammersmith & City line car
The travel agent somehow

Suiting into the exit
I am per Edgeware Road
The travel agent followed me and says
"Who are you to decode?"
The few clouds now are plateaued

```
In London, the shallow fog is antiretroviral
I walked opposite of the image and clap into South Harrow
Only I leapt onto the Piccadilly line
My let mood coolly zaro

I transferred at Hammersmith
A laundromat suffered past
I behold an opening outside of the Piccadilly line car
The laundromat now cast

Poking into the opening
I am in spite of Hounslow East
Suddenly inside the laundromat, I hear
"You are refusing to let something go that needs to be released"
The shallow fog now feels deceased

```
In London, the blowing snow is light sky blue
I turned for the Japanese restaurant and crumble into West Hampstead
Unabashedly, I walked onto the Jubilee line
My sereness less riverbed

I transferred at Bank
A sociology teacher with a soft blue waist
I discern a hatch beyond the Central line car
The sociology teacher disgraced

Placing into the hatch
I am with St. John's Wood
The sociology teacher found me and says
"You are doing what makes you feel good"
The blowing snow now feels misunderstood

```
In London, the light rain and breeze are automatic
I jumped beyond the rip and gather into Stonebridge Park
Truthfully, I sprinted onto the Bakerloo line
My self-assurity continually spark

I transferred at Oxford Circus
An aggressive tennis racket disagrees
I behold a secret door beside the Central line car
The tennis racket frieze

Popping into the secret door
I am close to Gants Hill
The tennis racket followed me and says
"You are becoming a channel of divine will"
The light rain and breeze now feels twill
