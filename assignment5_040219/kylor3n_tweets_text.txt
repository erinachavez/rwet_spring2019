let the past die. kill it if you have to.
i truly hate disloyal people
you can tell me the odds
ill listen
dear diary
i refuse to participate in fireworks celebrations as those were used to mark the destruction of the second Death Star
im surrounded by pietts and ozzels
dear diary
i continue to be ashamed of everyone
if anyone had asked me i could have told them that nobody cares about stories from Han S*lo’s youth but as usual noBody Asked
the more i learn about the past the more i realize that everyone is complicit
dear diary
i would NEVER card play or gamble or act like a scoundrel unlike some Others i could name and yet look at the response 
us nice guys never win i guess
i cant believe my parents never freed c3po 
and they claim to be heroes
cannot believe that was my last name for years
i am quite shaken
the sheer hypocrisy of Han Solo to act as though MINE was the made-up name
everything about my father is a lie but that comes as no surprise
dear diary
i think big weddings are absurd
i would prefer a small intimate ceremony like darth vader had
maybe two droids and NO FAMILY
*furiously attacks a grocery store display of Solo tie-in cups shrieking inarticulately with rage*
just another day on which i will begrudgingly postpone my mother’s inevitable destruction
wow Rey can you believe it is May the Fourth
i know we haven’t spoken in a little bit but uh i just wanted to wish you an uh a forceful day
just randomly
if you want to reach out my contact information has not changed
dear diary
hux says every great ruler needs a manifesto to rule efficiently but i think there’s such a thing as too many manifestos
loved infinity war
good uplifting film
dear diary
keep seeing h*n s*lo’s face everywhere but wrong somehow
i am still being punished i suppose
*thinks furiously of a retort for years*

im sure you ARE!
dear diary
luke skywalker is still upset because i pointed out he owed that rancor keeper an apology for ruining his livelihood and robbing him of his best friend
he only resents me because im right and he knows it
dear diary
my mom said the computer wasnt obeying her 
so i destroyed it  
but for some reason she wasn’t pleased
ive never felt so betrayedhttps://twitter.com/hottopic/status/983509944334012417 …
literally what do you have to do to get your dad to leave you alone
the loathsome resistance must diet
diet
diet
DIET
die
autocorrect sorry
dear diary
my uncle woke me up by standing over my bed with a lightsaber as a “prank”
i literally don’t understand how any part of this is a prank
ready player one looks good
i wonder if darth vader ever officiated weddings

i guess it’s better not to know
dear diary
everyone goes on and on about how good face masks are for you yet when i put on a face mask every day for years they become upSet
hey girl 
you must be sand people riding single file because i don’t know your number
*force-swipes right*
dear diary
i wonder what it’s like to overhear your parents saying positive things about you
dear diary
i mixed up a laundry by mistake and now my clothes that were deep black like the void in space left by destroying a traitorous planet are only light black like darth vader’s helmet in shadow on a moon
it is quite distressing
scarcely any of my outfits work
i wont miss my uncle
my aim is perfect
dance like no one is watching except the ghosts of your enemies who could theoretically be watching at any time and will not let you alone

i guess don’t dance
extra motivated to destroy a star today
dear diary
i love when someone tells you you’re wrong but then in that very same sentence you can see they don’t even know basic grammar
like this idiot yoda 
i totally owned him
give the people what they want. kill luke skywalker.
Luke Skywalker making light of robot discrimination is just typical of a man who would casually give C3PO — lovingly hand-made by darth vader himself — to Jabba the HuTt
hey girl am i a bothan spy because i am dying to get your information
*into mirror*
“...aggressive negotiations!”
*laughs loudly*
okay you’ve got this
have an imperial march
what base is it when you catch their lightsaber in midair
of course i am not a good loser 
ive never lost at anything how could i be GOOD at it
dear diary
you will not be surprised to learn that my uncle would not give equal time in his classroom to the theory that the Death Star was a controlled demolition from within
i think darth vader is the only adult who’s never let me down
okay any wampa who thinks my uncle isn’t a monster raise your left arm
dear diary
i think Chewbacca could always pilot That Ship by himself and he was just letting my dad do it because he felt bad
force ghosting is the worst way to break up with someone
it isn’t really a break up at all they just follow you around glowing and blue
they don’t make pod racers like darth vader any more
dear diary
nobody’s picking up my calls so i have spent most of the afternoon composing a long email that explains why all my actions were Rational and correct
but i am not quite ready to send it yet
pic.twitter.com/phbIzWLQOw
lightsabers are red
lightsabers are blue
let the past die
kill it if you have to
i’ve been doing something different with my hair
not hiding it under an enormous black helmet
*strolls along with hands in pockets whistling the imperial march*
i bet friendship is overrated
i use acronyms now 

DTF: destroy the Falcon
WTF: wreck the Falcon
BTS: blast that ship 
SMDH: stabbing my dad Han
AF: asteroid field 
NSFW: no sand fans welcome
ASL: as supreme leader
HMU: hate my uncle 
NP: no porgs
YMMV: yes my magnificent vader 
GTFO: glory tothe first order
you are not alone
i am here
remotely via webchat
i would like to see other people topless for a change
why do we waste time on bogus incidents from my father’s youth when *so many* darth vader stories remain untold
that’s not my real dad
personally id rather watch up to three films about young Darth Vader
im mortified
i made you a mixtape
i hope you like songs about darth vader 
and the sound of darth vader breathing
and someone reciting lyrics over the imperial march until they are rudely interrupted by a door opening and the voice says “MOM” loudly and is abruptly cut off
at least ive never milked anything
no this *is* a lightsaber in my pants actually but i'm also quite pleased to see you
just for Context here are some times my uncle said i showed that darkness was growing within me
-when i sighed loudly the third time he described himself as a legend
-i cut out part of my pancake to make it resemble a death star 
-i said pod racing was ‘wizard’
dear diary
i dont miss Chewbacca most of the time
he was a poor loser whereas i am a terrific sport
my family hates huts no matter how you spell them
dear diary
i have some regrets
i regret how terrible everyone else has been my whole life
i probably deserve to be in charge of the whole galaxy 
how hard can it be
historically people have done it in a bathrobe
please don’t leave
was it something i said 
or did
or my entire life up to this point 
whatever it was i am sure it can be fixed
well Rey if Luke Skywalker is so trustworthy then i’m SURE he’s told you about the incident when he knocked my Death Star birthday cake onto the floor by so-called accident
mom why is poe dameron’s drawing on the fridge
*force-pulls your pigtail*
hey am i the millennium falcon 
because i'm kind of falling apart all the time but i think it is han solo's fault
how much scar is too much 
this might be the one subject where i don’t trust darth vader’s guidance
is murder a good date activity
what if we have ravioli beforehand
im sorry 
but if you continue to resist i may be compelled to use the magic word
i dont believe luke skywalker should have been allowed to project
*rey's theme begins playing out of nowhere*
*rushes to backpack to switch off his phone*
im not sure i’ve ever received effective mentoring
dear diary
there was an incident at the drive through today because hux wouldn’t stop shouting my exact orders but louder
i hope that guy didn’t need his hand
excuse me
i have something for you to fix
it is myself
“are you an angel”
that’s what i should have said
people ought to have more sympathy for me
i am fatherless
one time my dad won a free surprise dinner with darth vader and he wasn’t even grateful
hey girl
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise 
i thought not
it’s not a story the jedi would tell you
you can hold hands through the internet Hux I’ve done it
excuse me mr snoke I am an *adult* in a mask
*angrily removes the plush darth vader from under his pillow* 
you have to let the past die
kill it if you have to
*carefully places him in bottom dresser drawer and tucks him in*
do you like galaxies 
so it turns out i kind of have one if you want to rule it with me or whatever
it wouldn’t have to be a date
dear diary
my mom explicitly said her workplace doesn't HAVE a bring your child to work day so i dont know why poe dameron was there
current emotional status: space slug watching its lunch fly away forever
let’s play spin the lightsaber
rey i have learned the truth about your parents
*force-cues music*
*clears throat*
i will be your father figure
put your tiny hand in mine

sorry there was supposed to be choreography here but we killed everyone else who was involved
men are from mars
women are from nowhere
i'm told i look very menacing when i nap
mom i know it’s always important for you to be at Poe Dameron‘s soccer games but my band concert is TODAY
dear diary 
i was a Wall Street Journal centerfold today 
hux is quite upset because this has been his dream for years and he slammed his print copy down on the table and said a strong wordpic.twitter.com/7IUdfb9d4x
dear diary
i wore black today but it was misconstrued
a relationship is when you listen to someone talk with your shirt on and also off
i heard girls dig bad boys so i am doing a murder
don’t call me a challenge
you’re not my mom
hey girl do you like Byronic heroes
more
mORE
*as he furiously squirts ketchup onto his fries*
MORE
dear diary
people make fun of my calligraphy but maybe if my mom or dad had better penmanship something that looked like “Snoke” wouldnt have been on my designated pick-up list at school
no hux
i definitely have a girlfriend
we speak with our minds 
she has a magic cave where she does syncopated snapping
and she’s super good with a lightsaber and like so strong with the force 
no i don’t know her last name 
but she definitely isn’t made up
what is that saying again about gloves and love
im worried i may have it backwards
*rises from couch with blanket wrapped around his shoulders*
*dramatically throws off blanket*
let the past die. kill it if you have to. it’s the only way to become who you were meant to be
uncle luke is just upset because the last time someone took his hand it was literally
i’m nice men
dear diary
the therapist at school said my ‘darth vader obsession’ is just a frantic plea to show my family i am worth saving but i choked him and threw him off a ledge
you are nobody
you are nothing
you DISGUST me
you don’t belong here
get out of here you nothingburger
wait come back i am building to something
dear diary
i hope my right hand is the one i get to keep
i don’t need to be redeemed
i’m not a cOUPOn
dear diary
sometimes i think my mom would relate to me better if i were more dashing and roguish 
so i’m taking up calligraphy
what base is it when she tears your lightsaber in half
a big relationship milestone is when she kisses her brother to fill you with jealousy but i dont think i am quite ready for that
i think most uncles are a hindrance
uncle luke used to agree
life day is for people who like life
dear diary
i’ve been very good lately
i almost didn’t do several bad things
I mean, i did
but afterwards i felt bad
which should count
someday i aspire to have the body confidence of jabba the hutt 
but for now i still need pants
people who have killed more than 50 percent of their parents make me sick
dear diary
i am going to meet up with my friend from online
im bringing handcuffs
i hope it’s not too forward
dear diary
i am reading pride and prejudice
it is pretty slow 
i thought there would be a kidnapping sooner
love is when you mostly listen to someone talk and then every so often you insult them 
at least i am pretty sure based on my parents
*uses the Force to blow his shirt open*
dear diary
i barely miss my dad
we had nothing in common
i have met a wonderful girl
either i’m gonna kill her or i’m beginning to like her
i just want a healthy relationship like darth vader had
dear diary
hux hasn’t slept in three weeks
he says he can sleep when i die 
i assume it’s a typo
how do you politely but firmly explain to someone that she is your girlfriend
*stands apologetically beneath your window with a boombox playing the Imperial March*
*puts on helmet*
look uncle luke 
i’m darth vader
do you think i am worth saving now
girl am i a hyperdrive 
because im broken and i think you should stay here and fix me instead of whatever else it was you had planned
u up?pic.twitter.com/SGxUtSHF2a
dear diary 
today i got to first base
it was a rebel base
i destroyed it
if someone said ‘i love you’ to me i would say it back 
unlike SOME people i could name
maybe the real villains are your heroes
dear diary 
today’s skype was not productive
she could clearly tell that the swelling love theme whenever she spoke was just me playing the oboe even though i made very few mistakes
our love is god
let’s go get a blue milk
is murder a love language
*stands in front of mirror for hours force-lifting a space pear onto a fork with a smile*
*keeps dropping pear*
*destroys mirror in a fit of rage*
dear diary 
i stood around all day shirtless and covered in oil in case i got an unexpected call but unfortunately i didn’t
no no a VERGENCE 
i said i was a lifelong vergence 
in the force like darth vader
hux i wish you wouldn’t listen on my calls
*flexes bicep* just got back from the arms dealer
*flexes other arm* they deal to both sides
hux please forward me that article about why the empire was right so i can send it to my friend from online
*chasing you down the sidewalk* excuse me we held hands in my mind so i believe legally you are now my wife
yesterday i heard the opening notes of Welcome To The Black Parade and i barely even turned my head
you’ve got to let the past die
*meticulously colors a bandaid black with sharpie*
how long should you wait in a relationship before you have the talk about sand
love means never having to say you’re sorry you did a genocide
i miss when my uncle’s catchphrase was silence
do both of you have to know it’s a date
hey girl am i a Death Star
because i feel like you should keep trying to rebuild me in spite of my obvious flaws and the lives i’ve destroyed
i want to put my fist through this whole lousy beautiful star system
yes i’m a monster
but have you considered that the real monster might be society
i’ve gotten much better at negging
i made a friend on skype
i’ve been working out
dear diary
there have been some changes
ive always felt i was destined to be a hero
do you ever worry that your life lacks a strong protagonist
maybe it's me
there is nothing worse than when you are watching a stirring tribute to young Darth Vader 
and then someone has photoshopped in your mom
maybe if you have to go around telling people you are rebels all the time your rebellion is lame
just a thought
people act like my dad's not a pushover but lando calrissian has mispronounced his first name for YEARS and he's never even corrected him
Solos are cowards
dadpic.twitter.com/abXfeoUdaf
i like the subtle ways they showed joker's character
like how he has "damaged" as a face tattoo or when he laughs in a big circle of knives
dear diary
the new joker was all right but i wish he hadn't let a woman be such a distraction to him
dear diary
i can't wait to see jared leto's joker 
it's going to be unbelievably hardcore
dear diary
hux is devastated
first i will reunite my chemical romance
next the empire
why the fuck would you make a film about my father's youth
they shouldn't let women bust ghosts
ghosts must be quite strong in the force and they deserve our respect
dear diary
I put a poster of this majestic view over my bed
my dad's throwing darts at it
I need a new poster or dadpic.twitter.com/rSPts5nOy3

we're barbecuing with the Ewoks 
I have a sunburn
I told my dad and he said "no, *i* have a SONburn"
I'm going indoors forever
freezing his ball mid-air was not cheating
i was sick of hearing "who serves first? i serve first? you serve first?"https://twitter.com/JohnBoyega/status/747830214735060992 …
this whole Rogue One movie sounds like biased anti-imperial propaganda but I will go just to see footage of Darth Vader in his prime

this day means nothing to me
dear diary
I was not appointed prom monarch 
this should not affect me
I'm not even disappointed
dear diary
i am commencing preparations for prom
my bow tie has finally arrivedpic.twitter.com/EAkeVO3Tkf
knowing who your parents are is overrated
happy june or so
dear diary
today has been very ho hum
my bow TIE has not arrived for prom yet
i wonder what I'll do all summer
meditate more I guess
why would anyone want to look in a mirror and see chewbacca
i dont really want to go to prom
it's an outdated ritual
but i guess it is something that's happening
nobody likes you when you're 23
dear diary
my dad has had too much to drink
he's trying to get me to use my powers to help him and uncle lando win at roulette
i hate him
dear diary
the bar just threw my dad out and now we have to run
I dont think they'll let us come back to see the Darth Vader museum tomorrow
mom
i am sorry I "ruined" your day by creating a scene in the restaurant 
the maitre d is being too dramatic about his hand
he has five more
dear diary
i am still in the parking lot 
c3po has been sharing a lot of facts with me
it is getting dark now
i guess they will be out soon
dear diary
the bar wouldn't let us in with c3po
I'm sitting in the parking lot with him so he won't get stolen
dad says they'll be out soon
dear diary
this weekend is off to a terrible start
my dad's been playing the Modal Nodes' Greatest Hits for 3 hours
he rejected my playlist
i'm so stressed
i feel like the walls are closing in something just moved past my leg 
maybe I am in a trash compactor come to consider it
dear diary
uncle lando and my dad and the wookiee want us to go on a boys' weekend to coruscant
i cannot imagine anything I would enjoy less
wtf 
this isn't even a namepic.twitter.com/yZRqTllwir

my dad said he will pay me triple my allowance, he just needs a little more time 
but he says that every week
this is an empire, isn't it?

I'm like 93% sure second base is when you touch a boob but Hux says it's a place on Dantooine
dear diary
today i figured out a way to put headphones into my helmet
i have often felt my life deserves a soundtrack
i wish my parents wouldn't fight 
they do it so much sometimes i think they enjoy it
I'm so upset just thinking of it

it's literally the greatest thing that can happen to a person
my uncle just described fighting Darth Vader in a dream-cave and at the end realizing he *was* Darth Vader as a "failure"

i can't
dear diary 
today was okay
men can be heroes too
"we lost our son forever"
dad we're at the grocery I'm literally right behind you
siri how do you know when you are past redemption
dear diary
mom says i cant have an ash tray in my bedroom
I tried to explain it's not for smoking it's for the remains of my enemies
i hope i live long enough to see myself become the villain
dear diary
my mom missed my band concert
she said she was busy leading a galactic resistance but I had a clarinet solo
i'm fine
even Darth Vader got rejected when he first applied to school and his test scores were insane
it's not like it's a rational process
dear diary
i found a tutorial of what to do under your helmet to not damage your hair
it was useful
here's a picturepic.twitter.com/xXyQEw8hQk
ugh these aren't delusions of grandeur, dad
my grandeur is real
should I do the talent show this year?
I could showcase my blade skill
Hux wants to read excerpts from The Fountainhead but I didn't say yes
my parents often say they wish they could delete my scenes
sometimes all you want is to just curl up under a blanket all day but instead you have to get up and be a dark lord
dear diary
i'm all stuffed up
but on the dark side my breathing sounds quite impressive with the helmet
dear diary
i think i am coming down with something
i've been sneezing into my helmet all morning
I wonder how Darth Vader dealt with this
dear diary
i wish people wouldn't say things cost an arm and a leg
my grandfather lost an arm and both legs and it wasn't a joking matter
.@VeryLonelyLuke If "Where's Waldo" were about you it'd be called "Who Gives A Shit Where Waldo Is Let's Go About Our Lives For 20 Years"
.@VeryLonelyLuke really YOU want to joke about people not visiting?
you shouldn't knock fanfiction when you're literally a Mary Sue
@VeryLonelyLuke
dear diary
Uncle Luke said he was raised entirely by his uncle
not sure what he wanted me to say but I guess "that explains a lot" wasn't it
dark knights don't need hugs mom
dad 
you know we have a recycling bin
not everything belongs in the trash compactor
especially not my new helmet
dear diary
today we discovered that Hux is allergic to wookiees
he can't come to the house again unless we vacuum
today was quite stressful
if I could have dinner with one person living or dead
it would be Darth Vader alive obviously 
why would you want dinner with a dead person
dad I'm not a big dark blur
put your glasses on
dear diary 
my mom said if I got a B+ or above in pre-calc i could paint my room black
but now she is altering the deal
"you're afraid you'll never be as strong as Darth Vader"
HOW DID YOU KNOW
"...kylo this room is a Vader shrine
i'm not even using the Force"
this birthday was an utter failurepic.twitter.com/nNfwiePs2D

we're off the asteroid!
my dad won't accept responsibility
he says it wasn't his fault
nothing is ever his fault according to him
dear diary
third day stuck on this asteroid
i dont think my dad knows how to fix the hyperdrive
it's like he's just hitting things at random
dear diary
dad and i are still stuck in the asteroid field
only now our parking spot is growling
dear diary
i missed band practice today
dad's shortcut through the asteroid field was not a shortcut AT ALL
we're still there actually
have an imperial march
music means a lot to me
listen MOM 
I'm an adult

hey wait 
don't unplug my Death Star nightlight I just want to admire it a little longer
hux says he is an alpha male
we agreed we are both alpha males
dear diary
i got my permit!
to celebrate we had the macaroni and cheese that is shaped like darth vader helmets 
today was almost all right
*sadly hums the imperial march as he walks home from school, force-kicking a rock in front of him*
dear diary
c3po told me he once convinced ewoks to serve my dad as a roast at a banquet in his honor
i have such new respect for him
they're called SLEEVES Rey
Darth Vader wore them a lot
dear diary
today an admiral named ackbar came to school to warn us about drugs
you will never guess what he said about them
hux is upset because i misspelled Nietzsche in this manifesto we're writing
it has one more s than it should
Darth Vader doesn't have an s
i have a bad feeling about this

i have a LOT of feelings about this

i have a lot of feelings in general
current emotional state: hanging upside down in a wampa cave while my tauntaun gets eaten
i don't understand why my mom gets so upset when I tell her there were heroes on both sides of the war of rebel aggression
it's the truth
dad
please pick up
a slug came by the house who says you owe him a lot of money
he won't leave
my mind trick didnt work on him
listen Rey
I think the Force is a little more complex than that
*as he tries and fails to force-open a bag of chips*
dad please stop telling me to "fly casual"
i dont know what that means
you are making me anxious when I am trying to focus
making a playlist of songs that remind me of Darth Vader

so far it's every song
hey girl are you a Death Star 
because Darth Vader would be upset you are taking so long to get ready
*clears throat*
are you a Death Star
because it's like you have a tractor beam that is pulling me in
lightsabers are red 
milk is blue
i hate sand

wait no i have this
dear diary
i have been practicing the imperial march on my clarinet a lot but i dont think it will be ready in time for tomorrow
excuse me?
my eyes are up here
inside this helmet
*someone gives him a Rorschach test*
why would you just hand me 30 ink pictures of darth vader
dear diary
ugh 
uncle lando is terrible at pictionary 
it was clearly my awesome helmet
and not a dead aardvark like he kept saying
excited to sleep so i can dream about darth vader
i wonder when i'm going to lose my first hand 
it should be soon
podracing is the only real sport 
i have so much respect for it
you must have Jedi reflexes if you race pods
i hate this picture

you can't even see my darth vader light-up sneakerspic.twitter.com/bgi5KMjd90
dear diary
I went to a Ren Fair today to meet up with other knights 
but it turns out it is something different
dear diary
personally i don't think "Nuremberg Rally" is a good birthday party theme AT ALL but i guess that's why Hux didn't ask me
you feel like han solo is the father you never had?
me too
rey please stop using that lightsaber it's a collector's item
*twitches*
kind of THE HOLY GRAIL for darth vader collectors actually
current emotional status: alderaan

he knows a lot
i wish more substitute teachers were like him

darth vader's haikus 
got the syllable count right
but so far mine don't
i'm not my father
you can tell me the odds
i just can't even
dear diary
c3po told me the chances of survival on my route to school were 725 to 1 and i shouted at him to shut up
am i becoming my father
Are You There Darth? It's Me, Kylo
you don't need a lot of fake friends when you have real friends like darth vader
mom
can you come pick me up
my tauntaun died
please hurry it is quite cold
dear diary
wow
c3po really loves to talk
darth vader must have felt it was important for him to tell people statistics but i dont know why
no i don't look "strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark" dad
that is gundark cruelty
language has power
*stands apologetically beneath your window with a boombox playing the Imperial March*
it's IN there
and now you'll GIVE it to me

you know who would have been a great host for SNL?
darth vader

he is darth vader's legacy

FYI mom
"if you see our son, bring him home" is way too dramatic of a way to ask dad to pick me up from band practice 
just in my opinion
if we don't resist the call of the light we're no better than moths
why don't YOU build another generation of Jedi @VeryLonelyLuke
yeah well DARTH VADER never SHOT his PHONE to get out of a conversation with his son, DAD
dear diary
i think my voice is changing
but it could be that i'm wearing a helmet with a voice changer now
i think dad's walking carpet resents me for some reason
i will NEVER go through mom's closet again for any reason
i touched it before I knew what it was
it was gold and metal
I'm scarred forever
hux says women are a distraction
i also mentioned that i would support a dictator and could see myself slaughtering sandpeople but by then she was quite far away
dear diary
today i spoke to a girl
i called her m'lady and said I hate sand
it worked for Darth Vader but i guess he knew something I don't
just to clarify: it is not a blankie 
it is an heirloom piece of darth vader's cape and i don't technically NEED it to fall asleep
*writes "search your feelings. you know it to be true" on his Converse in black sharpie*
i hate everythingpic.twitter.com/KThW6oSwNB
i believe in absolutes
sometimes i wish i weren't an only child
but mom says when you have siblings weird things can happen
is this bantha fodder locally sourced
i told my dad he should let me get my license since I share DNA with the best starpilot in the galaxy
he was touched but I meant darth vader
dear diary
today i moved all of Hux's pens around to show him my tremendous powers 
but Hux doesn't like it when people move his things
*approaches you at party*
*clears throat*
has anyone ever told you your eyes are the color of Darth Vader's helmet glinting in the moonlight
*gestures*
*door opens*
yes Rey you see when you are as powerful as I you can do these things
"kylo that was an automatic door"
dear diary
this one idiot ewok tripped and got a bucket stuck on his head
uncle lando goes "look, ben! it's you!"
he is the literal worst
dear diary
the stupid ewoks are visiting again
it's torture
we have had to sing "yub nub" three times
I never asked to be part of this tribe
wow dad great insight 
*rolls eyes* 
many Bothans died to bring us THAT information
what's the word for when your father is frozen in carbonite but emotionally for your whole childhood
~you are what you love, not who loves you~

i'm darth vader
ugh parsecs are units of distance DAD
pic.twitter.com/kEOaftJrom
dad said i remind him of jabba's palace because i have a little rancor in me
it felt like he'd planned it
mom didn't think it was that funny
my dad thinks he's so good at fixing things but he isn't really 
Darth Vader could fix anything
hux and I are building a new Death Star in place of the one that broke
hux says if we don't it lets them win
it will be the same but bigger
i told hux what my dad said about Death Stars and he is coming over for moral support
my dad just knocked over my model Death Star and broke it
but he did not apologize
he said people should stop making Death Stars
I'm shaking
my mom has done a lot of crazy things with her hair but i strive for more of a classic look myself
*constructs a new lightsaber to cut the crusts off his sandwiches*
uncle lando said my helmet made me look like a depressed lampshade and then everyone laughed and high-fived him
i hate this family so much
dear diary
today hux and I took a quiz to find our hogwarts houses
he got slytherin 
I got hufflepuff the first time but it was a mistake
current status: in a sarlacc pit 
but emotionally
when Darth Vader changed his name i bet they were jerks about it too 
people are small like that
i don't know why my family celebrates wookiee life day
it's bullshit
it's not even our heritage
dad can you please buy red milk next time instead of blue
Rey i see your ship is stuck in a swamp
luckily for you i am quite powerful in the force 
*strains*
*ship sinks deeper and disappears*
dear diary
hux and i have made livejournal accounts
his name on it is starkiller and mine is xXxVaderxXx
i wish more words rhymed with darth vader  
I guess not every poem needs to rhyme
mom 
please check your texts 
i had a fit of extreme power and rage where i mistakenly force-crushed my retainer
dear diary 
hux got me a poster of darth vader for my locker
i already have one just like it but bigger
however, i appreciated the thought
*indignantly removes wookiee hair from his black outfit with a lint roller* dad i told you that couch was off limits to him
dear diary
hux and i are meeting up by our lockers for an exchange of gifts
i got him a moleskine to write speeches in
hopefully he likes it
who the fuck is renly
a thing a lot of people don't realize about darth vader is what a way with words he had
i don't really want to read atlas shrugged but hux says it's a must
*once used the force to hold the door open for a lady*
*continues to use this as an example to prove sexism goes both ways*
*spends a whole afternoon unsuccessfully struggling to open a cling-wrapped My Chemical Romance cd*
fine I will go to the dance dad
but I will not dance 
I will wear a dark peacoat and stand in a corner with hux passing judgment on everyone
i miss darth vader every day but i've never even met him
chuck palahniuk just gets it
dear diary
the substitute math teacher kept calling me "rilo kiley"
it was upsetting 
hux says he is an untermensch 
I guess we are talking
dad the wookiee used all my garnier fructis
just once i wish my dad would respond to "I love you" with "I love you too" 
mom too for that matter
i wish i'd suffered more
sorry Rey no bottle openers 
but don't worry i know this great Force trick 
*concentrates fiercely*
"Kylo this one is a twist-off"
diary i think this is for the best
i was sick of watching 'triumph of the will' 
hux likes it way more than i do anyhow
dear diary
hux brought the forbidden cups to our party and now i'm not speaking to him
he knew where the line waspic.twitter.com/qSFbVmCLaZ
my dad owns too many vests
Darth Vader had no father
I envy him
*places Darth Vader's burned-out helmet on piano*
*painstakingly picks out the piano part to 'my immortal' with one finger*
*sets Vader breathing as his text message tone*
dear diary
at lunch hux read me part of this manifesto he's been writing
it really covered a lot of ground
*force-opens the door for you when you're too far away so you have to run for it*
you're WELCOME!
dear diary
hux and i are wearing black to commemorate the defeat at the battle of endor
we both always wear black but today it means more
fuck sand
seriously
*flexes bicep in his bathroom mirror* impressive... MOST impressive
mom please don't even pretend you know what I'm going through right now 
also we are out of conditioner
fight club is a great movie 
it gets to the truth of things
dear diary 
I told hux I did not think much of his name for our band 
he said I should go solo 
I told him never to mention that name again
dear diary
i told hux we should have a band of our own and he said yes but only if we call it Grand Moff Jerjerrod
i prefer dark craft beers
*reverently* that's so wizard
dear diary
some people are just shallow i guess
dear diary
i am taking grandfather's helmet to school today to show to hux at lunch
i expect he will be quite impressed
there is no way that han shot first
han is a coward
you're lucky I was here to help
with all my knowledge
*confidently plugs your droid into a blast pocket instead of a computer terminal*
grandpa
does my hair look okay
the dark side is the source of my unbelievable power
*as he angrily fails to unwrap a processed cheese slice*
i suppose i was just born into the wrong era
that's all
*calligraphies DARTH VADER on the cover of all his notebooks in black magic marker*
they make fun of me but kylo ren is a way realer name than biggs darklighter, the actual name of a man who my grandpa killed in a battle
my two favorite colors are black and red
*comes downstairs in pajamas* 
*clears throat* there's been an awakening 
are there pancakes?
holden caulfield knows what it means to commit to a bold choice of headgear and i respect that
i relate to holden caulfield
dear diary
hux let me borrow his copy of catcher in the rye
it's okay so far
this elliot smith song really makes me think of darth vader
*hands Rey a crossword*
don't worry if it takes a while 
Wednesday puzzles can be a bit challengi--
*Rey hands back the completed puzzle*
you can't truly appreciate the imperial march until you hear it on vinyl
what if men and women just have naturally different levels of force ability
i get all my winter clothes at Hoth Topic
my name is kyle
my name is kyle
my name is kyle
my name is KYLO
fucking autocorrect
i should warn you that am very strong in the force
*tries to force-pull the cap off a pen*
*can't*
hux is all right but he likes wagner too much
dear diary
mom and dad still don't believe that my name is kylo
dad laughs whenever i say it
nobody at school calls me kylo but hux
wookiee life day is a bullshit holiday
dear diary
hux wants me to come over and watch the films of leni riefenstahl
but it doesn't sound like darth vader is in them
the only person who could truly understand what i'm going through died on the second death star before i was even born
*applies black eyeliner*
my parents don't understand me and i hate them
*applies black helmet*
should my yearbook quote be "the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force" or "yippee"
podracing is the realest sport 
i respect podracers so much
ewoks are traitors
*picks out all the green and blue M&Ms and just eats the red ones*
*force-slams his bedroom door*
i'm wearing this black armband in honor of darth vader remembrance day
it's every day
i'm a force choker in a @HotTopic choker
*into mirror* apology ACCEPTED, captain needa 
*voice cracks unexpectedly*
dear diary
hux loaned me his copy of mein kampf
he loves it but i thought it was a HUGE disappointment
no mentions of Darth Vader AT ALL
*sings sadly into mirror*
when will my reflection show 
who i am inside?
*puts on dark helmet*
dear diary
hux and i sat together at lunch
he agrees that the destruction of alderaan was justified
*sidles up to you at a party* the thing most people don't understand about midichlorians is
this is me now
it's not a tantrum MOM
*serenading vader's burned-out helmet* wake me up inside 
(i can't wake up) wake me up inside
hux do you want to come to hot topic and look at vintage imperial posters with me
*hands Rey an xbox controller* it's cool if you don't beat it the first try
i didn't
you have to really learn and practice
*rey beats it*
*comments angrily on a YouTube video*
*sits there for three hours reloading the page*
what about the civilian contractors who lost their lives on the second death star
heritage not hatepic.twitter.com/Lt9jRHfVbh
*sighs* i wish i'd been born 60 years ago
i guess i just have an old soul
i'm not manspreading i'm saving this seat for darth vader
is this your card?
well is THIS your card?
no wait hang on i've got this
i hate sand
grandpa was right
it gets everywhere
#notallsith
*jar won't open*
*takes jar into kitchen*
*much grunting*
*three hours pass*
*entire kitchen is destroyed except jar which remains sealed*
*force-tosses you across the room* it's a TRILBY
*corners you at a party to explain the Force to you even though you literally wrote the book on it and all he read was the review*
my dad just doesn't understand me
no one understands me but you
grandpa
*makes a mixtape but it's just My Immortal and Darth Vader's theme over and over*
it's about ethics in Force journalism
i just don't think girls GET why darth vader is so great
*writes 10 posts in ALL CAPS rebutting your argument but his only sources are geocities pages that haven't been updated since 2002*
*angrily failing to cut the crusts off his own sandwiches*
hot topic is a pretty great store
dear diary
i met a guy at lunch named hux 
he has read nietzche he says
he says everyone should read nietzche
*comes to school after a three-day weekend* my name isn't Ben any more it's KYLO REN and i'm a dark knight
*draws Darth Vader on his hand in black sharpie*
