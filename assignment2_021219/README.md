For this assignment, I created a dadaist poetry generator! This was my first time experimenting creatively with text utilizing python. In short, a user is able to search for a song, and the program will shuffle the resulting song's lyrics into a unique dadaist poem. If you are able, please download the notebook and try it out for yourself!
