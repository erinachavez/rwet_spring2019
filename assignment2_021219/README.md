### Assignment 2: Poetry Generator

*February 12th, 2019*

---
For this assignment, I created a [dadaist poetry generator](poetry_generator.ipynb)! This was my first time experimenting creatively with text utilizing python. In short, a user is able to search for a song, and the program will shuffle the resulting song's lyrics into a unique dadaist poem. If you are able, please download the notebook and try it out for yourself!

**Sample Output**

```
Search for a Song: nobody mitski
Results for: Nobody by Mitski
