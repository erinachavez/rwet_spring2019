    "This poetry generator is inspired by block poetry. My method is as follows:\n",
    "- First, read in a txt document. Preferably a novel, for they typically have many large blocks of paragraphs.\n",
    "- Then, split the document up. A document list consists of smaller paragraph lists, each holding individual lines.\n",
    "- Randomly choose a number of paragraphs from the list. In my case, I am choosing 11 total paragraphs.\n",
    "- The first 10 of these paragraphs will be used to collect words to remove from the eleventh.\n",
    "- Generate a single list of words collected from the \"to remove\" paragraphs.\n",
    "- Generate a list of lines, each its own list of words, to represent the eleventh paragraph (here called \"source\")\n",
    "- Iterating through each line and word in source, check if the given word is in the \"to remove\" list. If so, replace it with a new line character.\n",
    "- Print the resulting block poem!\n",
    "\n",
    "I played around with the idea of replacing words to remove with \"X\" or \"◼\", but found that they were too distracting when reading. They also helped reveal the original construction of the sentence, which made it difficult to see the poem as its own unique piece. Thus, I've come to appreciate the large gaps between lines in my resulting poems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, I decided to read in Franz Kafka's _Metamorphosis_ for two reasons. Conceptually, I imagined myself generating these poems by breaking up and transforming a single entity, using its own parts to do so. It felt like a transformation-- a metamorphosis-- of the text, free from the addition of outside attributes. Secondly, it just happened to produce very beautiful results."
