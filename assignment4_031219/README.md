### Assignment 4: Chain Abstractions

*March 12th, 2019*

---
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a new poetic form and generating a number of poems from it. Rather straightforwardly, I've decided to call my new form "Chain Abstractions." Definitely check out my [documentation and examples](https://github.com/erinachavez/rwet_spring2019/blob/master/assignment4_031219/new_poetic_form.ipynb), and think on what aspects you may change or experiment with!

**Sample Outputs**

```
A birth
    is a blessed event,
           but a birthright is
to be right
    is to be privelege,
          but to be rightwing is
to be wing?
```
```
A door
    is a portal,
          but a doorstop is

```
