[music fades in softly and grows in volume, wavers gently]

Ooh [quietly, and grows in volume. note slides up and down]
[guitar begins to finger-pick repetitive riff]
Ooh

I'm lying in my bed
The blanket is warm
This body will never be
Safe from harm
Still feel your hair,
Black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin
   [guitar strummed once]     [note held, slides up slightly]

[vocal slide up]
Oh-             if only you'd come back to me

Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin

[music's energy increases slightly]

Don't wanna weep for you
Don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured
The white horses flow
Memories fire
                   [note held, vocal slide down]
The rhythms fall slo-                           w

[music picks up again]

[vocal slide up]
Oh              precious, precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
[slight growl]
Screa-        ming down from heaven
                                                           [music fades away]

Don't wanna weep for you

[music's energy increases; electric guitar and drum in unison, panicked]

so [whispered]

[music cuts and fades away]
[note held, vocal slide up, stepped back down, continues to croon softly]
Ah-


Oh the welts of your scorn, my love
Give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back
Give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
                           [music fades away]
                           [vocal slide down]    [note held]
