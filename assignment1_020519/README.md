### Assignment 1: Transcriptions

*February 5th, 2019*

---
For this assignment, I transcribed three songs from Jeff Buckley's 1994 album, *Grace*. For each song I chose— *Mojo Pin*, *Lilac Wine*, and *So Real*— I transcribed them in unique ways.

[*Mojo Pin*](mojopin.txt) was the first song I transcribed. Honestly, I simply did what came most naturally to me. You will see multiple brief messages encased in square brackets ([]), hovering over several lines of lyrics. Paired with the breaks in the lyrical texts themselves, they are meant to represent exactly where and what is happening both musically and with Buckley's voice.

[*Lilac Wine*](lilacwine.txt) is a slow, airy, but deep ballad that focuses intently on Buckley's vocal talent. Thus here I altered the lyrics to represent exactly what I was hearing him sing.

With [*So Real*](soreal.txt), I find the shifting energies of the song, and Buckley's own motivations vexing. Thus, in my final transcription, I decided to tackle the song in a way most foreign to me— by trying to write out how the song felt. I found marked changes every couple lines or so. At each point, I wrote how I felt the music changed and what Buckley was revealing about his inner emotions whilst singing.
