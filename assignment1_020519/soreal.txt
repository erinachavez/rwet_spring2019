Track #5: So Real
----------
[
  Music starts simply and softly, a single electric guitar.
  In the same moment we first hear Buckley's voice, music's energy picks up.
  Buckley's voice fades in, calling out to a love.
  He sounds wistful and pleading.
  As he sings, the music fades in energy.
]
Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch
And remember the smell of the fabric
Of your simple city dress

[
  Music picks up once again.
  Buckley now singing with much more energy, as if he's remembering, and truly feeling, the weight of his memory.
]
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real

[
  Music's energy eases, but the beat remains incessant.
  Buckley seems to fade back into his memories.
]

We walked around til the moon got full like a plate
And the wind blew an invocation, I fell asleep at the gate

[
  Buckley sounds a tinge regretful? His singing sounds more helpless and urgent to get out.
  When singing about his nightmare, Buckley sounds anxious.
]
And I never stepped on the cracks cause I thought I'd hurt my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under
Pulled me under

Oh...
[
  Music picks up.
  Buckley again singing with increased energy.
]
That was so real
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real

[
  As Buckley holds out "real" above, music's energy, un-unified, grows in both volume, and chaos.
  Buckley seems to be swallowed by the electric instruments and drums as they crash and warble together.
  Almost as soon as they started, the instruments let their warbled energy fade.

  Music cuts
  Buckley, briefly, clearly, in regular speech, and with a heavy voice.
]
I love you

[
  Music begins again, softer but not ignorable
]
but I'm afraid to love you

[
  Softer, evoking more emotion. Buckley sounds exhausted with his confession
]
I love you

but I'm afraid to love you

I'm afraid...

[
  Music picks up.
  Buckley again singing with increased energy.
]
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real

[
  At last "so real" above, it's clear that the song isn't over yet.
  Both instruments' and Buckley's energy picks up, as they come together for a freeform ending
]
Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real

Uuhhhh

[
  Buckley's voice starts to overlap with his own, adding to his apparent desperation and the music's chaos
  As he repeats "real," we reach the pinnacle of Buckley's screaming out. We're reminded of why he's singing, and thus who may be singing to.
]
Oh... that was so real
Real Real Real

Oh... that was so real
Oh... that was so real

[
  With the singing of "Oh... yeah," it sounds as if Buckley is coming to a close.
  Sure enough, he sings the line "Oh... that was so real," once more before both voice and instruments fade out together.
]
Oh... yeah
Oh... that was so real

[
  In the few seconds of silence after, the high energy very quickly dissipates. The listener is brought back down to earth.
